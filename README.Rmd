Julia [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl) and [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl) implementation of bootstrapped cluster-based permutation analysis for time series data, powered by [`JuliaConnectoR`](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR).

## Installation

You can install the development version of jlmerclusterperm from [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm")
```

Using `jlmerclusterperm` requires a prior installation of Julia, which can be downloaded from either the [official website](https://julialang.org/) or using the command line utility [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). Julia version >=1.8 is required and >=1.9 is preferred for its substantial compiler/runtime improvements.

Before using functions from `jlmerclusterperm`, an initial setup step is required via calling `jlmerclusterperm_setup()`. This will launch Julia with some number of threads (controlled via `options("jlmerclusterperm.nthreads")`) and install necessary package dependencies (this only happens once and should take about 15-30 minutes).

Subsequent calls to `jlmerclusterperm_setup()` incur a small overhead of around 30 seconds and there will be slight delays for first-time function calls due to Julia's [just-in-time compilation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/). Afterwards you can enjoy blazingly-fast functions from the package.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
# Both lines must be run
library(jlmerclusterperm)
jlmerclusterperm_setup(verbose = FALSE)
```
