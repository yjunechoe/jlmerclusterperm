Julia [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl) and [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl) implementation of bootstrapped cluster-based permutation analysis (CPA) for time series data, powered by [JuliaConnectoR](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR).

## Installation and usage

You can install the development version of jlmerclusterperm from [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm")
```

Using `jlmerclusterperm` requires a prior installation of Julia, which can be downloaded from either the [official website](https://julialang.org/) or using the command line utility [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). Julia version >=1.8 is required and 1.9 is preferred for its substantial speed improvements.

Before using functions from `jlmerclusterperm`, an initial setup step is required via calling `jlmerclusterperm_setup()`. The very first call on a system will start Julia and install necessary dependencies (this only happens once and takes 15-30 minutes).

Subsequent calls to `jlmerclusterperm_setup()` incur a small overhead of around 30 seconds, plus slight delays for first-time function calls due to Julia's [just-in-time compilation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/). You pay up front for start-up and warm-up costs and get blazingly-fast functions from the package.

```{r setup}
# Both lines must be run
library(jlmerclusterperm)
system.time(jlmerclusterperm_setup(verbose = FALSE))
```

See the [Articles](https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/articles/) page on the [package website](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) for in-depth tutorials and case study vignettes.

## Quick tour of package functionalities

### Complete CPA with `clusterpermute()`

A time series data:

```{r chickweight, message = FALSE}
chickweights <- ChickWeight
chickweights$Time <- as.integer(factor(chickweights$Time))
matplot(
  tapply(chickweights$weight, chickweights[c("Time", "Diet")], mean),
  type = "b", lwd = 3, ylab = "Weight", xlab = "Time"
)
```

Preparing a specification object:

```{r chickweights_spec}
chickweights_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet,
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
chickweights_spec
```

Cluster-based permutation test:

```{r CPA}
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100,
  progress = FALSE
)
```

With random effects:

```{r chickweights_re_spec}
chickweights_re_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet + (1 | Chick),
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_re_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100,
  progress = FALSE
)$empirical_clusters
```

### Piecemeal approach to CPA

Computing time-wise statistics of the observed data:

```{r empirical_statistics}
empirical_statistics <- compute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec)
tidy(empirical_statistics)
```

```{r plot-empirical_statistics}
matplot(t(empirical_statistics), type = "b", pch = 1, lwd = 3, ylab = "t-statistic")
abline(h = 2.5, lty = 3)
```

Identifying empirical clusters:

```{r empirical_clusters}
empirical_clusters <- extract_empirical_clusters(empirical_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
empirical_clusters
```

Simulating the null distribution:

```{r null_statistics}
set_rng_state(123L)
null_statistics <- permute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec, nsim = 100)
null_cluster_dists <- extract_null_cluster_dists(null_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
null_cluster_dists
```

Significance testing the cluster-mass statistic:

```{r calculate_clusters_pvalues}
calculate_clusters_pvalues(empirical_clusters, null_cluster_dists, add1 = TRUE)
```

Iterating over a range of threshold values:

```{r walk_threshold_steps}
walk_threshold_steps(
  empirical_statistics, null_statistics,
  threshold_steps = c(2, 2.5, 3)
)
```
