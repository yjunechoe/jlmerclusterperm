Julia [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl) and [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl) based implementation of cluster-based permutation analysis for time series data, powered by [JuliaConnectoR](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR).

## Overview

**Cluster-based permutation analysis (CPA)** is a simulation-based, non-parametric statistical test of difference between groups in a time series. It is suitable for analyzing **densely-sampled time data** (e.g., eye gaze, EEG) when the research hypothesis is often specified up to the existence of an effect (e.g., as predicted by higher-order cognitive mechanisms) but agnostic to the structural details of the temporal event (e.g., the precise moment of an effect's emergence).

CPA formalizes two intuitions about what it means for there to be a difference between groups:

1) The countable unit of difference (i.e., a **cluster**) is a contiguous, uninterrupted span of _sufficiently large_ differences at each time point (determined via a pre-determined threshold).

2) The degree of extremity of a cluster (i.e., the **cluster-mass statistic**) is a measure that is sensitive to the magnitude of the difference, its variability, and the sample size (e.g., the t-statistic from a regression).

In short, the CPA procedure identifies empirical clusters in a time series and tests the significance of the cluster-mass statistics against bootstrapped permutations of the data simulating the null.

`jlmerclusterperm` is an interface to a regression-based CPA which supports both wholesale and piecemeal approaches to conducting a CPA. See the [Articles](https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/articles/) page on the [package website](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) for tutorials and case studies.


## Installation and usage

You can install the development version of jlmerclusterperm from [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm")
```

Using `jlmerclusterperm` requires a prior installation of Julia, which can be downloaded from either the [official website](https://julialang.org/) or using the command line utility [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). Julia version >=1.8 is required and [1.9](https://julialang.org/blog/2023/04/julia-1.9-highlights/#caching_of_native_code) is preferred for its substantial speed improvements.

Before using functions from `jlmerclusterperm`, an initial setup is required via calling `jlmerclusterperm_setup()`. The very first call on a system will install necessary dependencies (this only happens once and takes around 10-15 minutes).

Subsequent calls to `jlmerclusterperm_setup()` incur a small overhead of around 30 seconds, plus slight delays for first-time function calls. You pay up front for start-up and warm-up costs and get blazingly-fast functions from the package.

```{r setup}
# Both lines must be run at the start of each new session
library(jlmerclusterperm)
system.time(jlmerclusterperm_setup(verbose = FALSE))
```

## Quick tour of package functionalities

### Wholesale CPA with `clusterpermute()`

A time series data:

```{r chickweight, message = FALSE}
chickweights <- ChickWeight
chickweights$Time <- as.integer(factor(chickweights$Time))
matplot(
  tapply(chickweights$weight, chickweights[c("Time", "Diet")], mean),
  type = "b", lwd = 3, ylab = "Weight", xlab = "Time"
)
```

Preparing a specification object:

```{r chickweights_spec}
chickweights_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet,
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
chickweights_spec
```

Cluster-based permutation test:

```{r CPA}
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100,
  progress = FALSE
)
```

With random effects:

```{r chickweights_re_spec}
chickweights_re_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet + (1 | Chick),
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_re_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100,
  progress = FALSE
)$empirical_clusters
```

### Piecemeal approach to CPA

Computing time-wise statistics of the observed data:

```{r empirical_statistics}
empirical_statistics <- compute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec)
matplot(t(empirical_statistics), type = "b", pch = 1, lwd = 3, ylab = "t-statistic")
abline(h = 2.5, lty = 3)
```

Identifying empirical clusters:

```{r empirical_clusters}
empirical_clusters <- extract_empirical_clusters(empirical_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
empirical_clusters
```

Simulating the null distribution:

```{r null_statistics}
set_rng_state(123L)
null_statistics <- permute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec, nsim = 100)
null_cluster_dists <- extract_null_cluster_dists(null_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
null_cluster_dists
```

Significance testing the cluster-mass statistic:

```{r calculate_clusters_pvalues}
calculate_clusters_pvalues(empirical_clusters, null_cluster_dists, add1 = TRUE)
```

Iterating over a range of threshold values:

```{r walk_threshold_steps}
walk_threshold_steps(empirical_statistics, null_statistics, steps = c(2, 2.5, 3))
```
