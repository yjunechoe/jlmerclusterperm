Julia [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl) and [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl) based implementation of the cluster-based permutation test for time series data, powered by [JuliaConnectoR](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR).

## Installation and usage

Install the released version of jlmerclusterperm from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("jlmerclusterperm")
```

Or install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm")
```

Using `jlmerclusterperm` requires a prior installation of the Julia programming language, which can be downloaded from either the [official website](https://julialang.org/) or using the command line utility [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). Julia version >=1.8 is required and [1.9](https://julialang.org/blog/2023/04/julia-1.9-highlights/#caching_of_native_code) or higher is preferred for the substantial speed improvements.

Before using functions from `jlmerclusterperm`, an initial setup is required via calling `jlmerclusterperm_setup()`. The very first call on a system will install necessary dependencies (this only happens once and takes around 10-15 minutes).

Subsequent calls to `jlmerclusterperm_setup()` incur a small overhead of around 30 seconds, plus slight delays for first-time function calls. You pay up front for start-up and warm-up costs and get blazingly-fast functions from the package.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
# Both lines must be run at the start of each new session
library(jlmerclusterperm)
jlmerclusterperm_setup()
```

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
```

See the [Get Started](https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/articles/jlmerclusterperm.html) page on the [package website](https://yjunechoe.github.io/jlmerclusterperm/) for background and tutorials.

## Quick tour of package functionalities

### Wholesale CPA with `clusterpermute()`

A time series data:

```{r chickweight, message = FALSE}
chickweights <- ChickWeight
chickweights$Time <- as.integer(factor(chickweights$Time))
matplot(
  tapply(chickweights$weight, chickweights[c("Time", "Diet")], mean),
  type = "b", lwd = 3, ylab = "Weight", xlab = "Time"
)
```

Preparing a specification object with `make_jlmer_spec()`:

```{r chickweights_spec}
chickweights_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet,
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
chickweights_spec
```

Cluster-based permutation test with `clusterpermute()`:

```{r CPA, message = FALSE}
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100
)
```

Including random effects:

```{r chickweights_re_spec, message = FALSE}
chickweights_re_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet + (1 | Chick),
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_re_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100
)$empirical_clusters
```

### Piecemeal approach to CPA

Computing time-wise statistics of the observed data:

```{r empirical_statistics}
empirical_statistics <- compute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec)
matplot(t(empirical_statistics), type = "b", pch = 1, lwd = 3, ylab = "t-statistic")
abline(h = 2.5, lty = 3)
```

Identifying empirical clusters:

```{r empirical_clusters}
empirical_clusters <- extract_empirical_clusters(empirical_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
empirical_clusters
```

Simulating the null distribution:

```{r null_statistics}
set_rng_state(123L)
null_statistics <- permute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec, nsim = 100)
null_cluster_dists <- extract_null_cluster_dists(null_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
null_cluster_dists
```

Significance testing the cluster-mass statistic:

```{r calculate_clusters_pvalues}
calculate_clusters_pvalues(empirical_clusters, null_cluster_dists, add1 = TRUE)
```

Iterating over a range of threshold values:

```{r walk_threshold_steps, message = FALSE}
walk_threshold_steps(empirical_statistics, null_statistics, steps = c(2, 2.5, 3))
```
