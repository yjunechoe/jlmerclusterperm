Julia [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl) implementation of cluster-based permutation test for time series data, powered by [{JuliaConnectoR}](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR)

## Installation

You can install the development version of jlmerclusterperm from [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm")
```

## Setup

```{r example}
# library(jlmerclusterperm)
# system.time({jlmerclusterperm_setup()})
```

## Basic example

Example data:

```{r ex-data}
head(ChickWeight)
fm <- weight ~ 1 + Diet + (1 | Chick)
```

```{r}
chickweights_m <- tapply(ChickWeight$weight, ChickWeight[c("Time", "Diet")], mean)
matplot(chickweights_m, type = "b", lwd = 3)
```
