Julia [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl) and [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl) implementation of bootstrapped cluster-based permutation analysis for time series data, powered by [`JuliaConnectoR`](https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR).

## Installation

You can install the development version of jlmerclusterperm from [GitHub](https://github.com/yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("yjunechoe/jlmerclusterperm")
```

Using `jlmerclusterperm` requires a prior installation of Julia, which can be downloaded from either the [official website](https://julialang.org/) or using the command line utility [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). Julia version >=1.8 is required and >=1.9 is preferred for its substantial compiler/runtime improvements.

Before using functions from `jlmerclusterperm`, an initial setup step is required via calling `jlmerclusterperm_setup()`. This will launch Julia with some number of threads (controlled via `options("jlmerclusterperm.nthreads")`) and install necessary package dependencies (this only happens once and should take about 15-30 minutes).

Subsequent calls to `jlmerclusterperm_setup()` incur a small overhead of around 30 seconds and there will be slight delays for first-time function calls due to Julia's [just-in-time compilation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/). Afterwards you can enjoy blazingly-fast functions from the package.

```{r setup}
# Both lines must be run
library(jlmerclusterperm)
system.time(jlmerclusterperm_setup(verbose = FALSE))
```

## Quick tour of package functionalities

### Complete CPA with `clusterpermute()`

A time series data:

```{r chickweight, message = FALSE}
chickweights <- ChickWeight
chickweights$Time <- as.integer(factor(chickweights$Time))
matplot(
  tapply(chickweights$weight, chickweights[c("Time", "Diet")], mean),
  type = "b", lwd = 3, ylab = "Weight", xlab = "Time"
)
```

Preparing a specification object:

```{r chickweights_spec}
chickweights_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet,
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
chickweights_spec
```

Cluster-based permutation test:

```{r CPA}
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100,
  progress = FALSE
)$empirical_clusters
```

Using custom contrast coding:

```{r chickweights_helm}
chickweights_helm <- chickweights
contrasts(chickweights_helm$Diet) <- contr.helmert(4)
colnames(contrasts(chickweights_helm$Diet)) <- c("1v2", "12v3", "123v4")
contrasts(chickweights_helm$Diet)
```

```{r chickweights_helm_spec}
chickweights_helm_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet,
  data = chickweights_helm,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_helm_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100,
  progress = FALSE
)$empirical_clusters
```

With random effects:

```{r chickweights_re_spec}
chickweights_re_spec <- make_jlmer_spec(
  formula = weight ~ 1 + Diet + (1 | Chick),
  data = chickweights,
  subject = "Chick", time = "Time"
)
set_rng_state(123L)
clusterpermute(
  chickweights_re_spec,
  threshold = 2.5,
  nsim = 100,
  progress = FALSE
)$empirical_clusters
```

### Components of a CPA

Time-wise statistics of the data:

```{r empirical_statistics}
empirical_statistics <- compute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec)
tidy(empirical_statistics)
```

```{r plot-empirical_statistics}
matplot(t(empirical_statistics), type = "l", ylab = "t-value")
abline(h = 2.5, lty = 3)
```

Empirical clusters:

```{r empirical_clusters}
empirical_clusters <- extract_empirical_clusters(empirical_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
empirical_clusters
```

Simulating the null:

```{r null_statistics}
set_rng_state(123L)
null_statistics <- permute_timewise_statistics(chickweights_spec, nsim = 100)
null_cluster_dists <- extract_null_cluster_dists(null_statistics, threshold = 2.5)
```

Significance testing:

```{r calculate_clusters_pvalues}
calculate_clusters_pvalues(empirical_clusters, null_cluster_dists, add1 = TRUE)
```

Testing a range of thresholds values:

```{r walk_threshold_steps}
walk_threshold_steps(
  empirical_statistics,null_statistics,
  threshold_steps = c(2, 2.5, 3)
)
```
